    <h1>Welcome to the beginning!</h1>

    <p>Often when people are starting a new worldbuilding project, theyre not sure where or how to begin.</p>
    <p>THis is where this website comes in handy!  Outlining each step in order form the most basic to complex ideas.</p>
    <p>Ideally in the future I would like to impliment an AI assistant that will help generate some of the more complicated parts, but everything is designed to be fully accessable without assistance.</p>
    <p>Often worldbuilding specific niches that you are interested in requires outside knowledge beyond tyhe scope of this website, so I will try and link wikipedia articles when applicable.</p>
