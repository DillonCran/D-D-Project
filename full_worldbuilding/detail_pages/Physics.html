    <h1>Physics</h1>

    <p>This section is to lay out the general rules of you world</p>
    <p>The main method for this will be to create an extra system that is on top of real world rules</p>
    <p>whether the characters in your world understand these processes or not is up to you</p>
    <p>the point being that to the unknowing it will appear as magic while allowing for believability</p>
    <p>It is 100% OKAY to just use IRL physics for this section if you dont plan on having any magical or extra-real abilities</p>
    <p>AN example of a really good belivable system is Alchemy in Full Metal Alchemist</p>
    <p>Aside from the world heavily integrating it into society (this will be covered later) it is believable because it has at least a surface layer of logic to it</p>

    <p>For my personal homebrew D&D campaign I have the universe set into two multiverses, with only one being physical reality</p>
    <p>The other universe acts as a counterbalance for energy transfer, and while life/conciousness cannot be created there due to the chaotic nature of being pure energy, sapient creatures can access it through the energy of emotions (and thus channel magic)</p>
    <p>In my homebrew this parallell dimension is also the home of the gods, birthed when life first gained sapience.  While it is not necissary you can also tie in your gods/pantheon to these processes</p>

    <p>Is there a multiverse in your world? Cosmology of the universe?  Other universes usually have a literary purpose</p>


    <h1>chemistry</h1>

    <p>This also relates back to physics as above in that its best to create these together in mind to allow them to be more believable</p>
    <p>Elements can be pure (Oxygen) or compounds (water), either are fine to create but pure elements are in general less believable due to there being no extra room on the periodic table</p>
    <p>These again should also serva a literary purpose, but IMO the main point should be making something cool for your world</p>
    <p>Use these new elements to compliment the new physics in your world.  In my D&D game because the gods do not have emtions themselves and must gain them from the other universe, they manifest as non-emotional concepts (Luck,Fate,Death)</p>
    <p>Other good examples are Adamantite, Unobtaium, Songsteel.  As long as the new element is interesting and has potential for narritive use its a good idea.</p>
    <p>Again it is also worth noting its 100% OKAY to not have any new elements and just use real world only.</p>
