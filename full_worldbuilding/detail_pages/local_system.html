    <h1>Creating your local system!</h1>

    <h3>Star</h3>
    <p>Stars can come in many different sizes and colours</p>
    <p>
      realistically they can look however you want for your world, but realism
      is always more believable
    </p>
    <p>
      In general the bigger the star the shorter lived it is, and the smaller
      the star the lponger lived. If your world is 10bil years old it would need
      to be on a smaller star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stars can be any colour, but the colour is determined by the temperature
      of the star. The hotter the star the more blue it is, the cooler the star
      the more red it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stars can be binary, trinary, or even more. Binary stars are two stars
      orbiting each other, trinary are three stars orbiting each other, and so
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, multiple stars can create whackey orbits. This can create some
      interesting solar events!
    </p>
    <p>
      Stars can also be variable, meaning they can change in brightness. This
      can be due to a number of reasons, but the most common is that the star is
      a binary star and the other star is blocking the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stars can also be variable due to the star itself. This can be due to the
      star being young and still forming, or the star is dying and is unstable.
    </p>

    <h3>Solar System</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you have the central star of your solar system, lets outline the
      rest of the system
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical systems have rocky terrestrial planets closer to the star, and
      large gas giants further away, with smaller exoplanets and belts of comets
      encircling the outter perimiter
    </p>
    <p>
      However, your system can be whatever you want it to be. You can have a
      system with no gas giants, or a system with no terrestrial planets. You
      can have a system with no exoplanets, or a system with no comets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, the more planets a system has the more stable it is. This is
      because the planets can help stabalize each other's orbits. However, this
      is not always the case. Some systems are very unstable, and some systems
      are very stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take this oppertunity to outline those stellar objects in rough detail,
      keeping in mind how they may play into mythology or cosmic events visible
      from your main world
    </p>
    <p>
      examples (eclipses, planet alignments, star visual events, moon
      alignments)
    </p>
    <p>
      For each stellar object you create, make a rough outline of that they are
      using stats for size,
    </p>
    <p>
      size, type(gas,rocky,ice world,etc), orbit speed, orbit position(from the
      sun), moons, average temp(eath is 14C), planet tilt
    </p>
    <p>
      General rules of thumb, moon(s) on your main planet should be decently
      large as large moons stabalize orbits
    </p>
    <p>
      The tilt of a planet will determine how extreme seasons are, lower tilt
      means less extreme seasons
    </p>
    <p>There should be 8 - 10 stellar objects in your system</p>

    <h3>Your Planet</h3>
    <p>
      Your main planet, like all the other objects, can be whatever you want
      regardless of realism
    </p>
    <p>
      however, if youd like to be more realistic there are some things to
      consider
    </p>
    <p>
      the size of your planet will determine the gravity, the larger the planet
      the more gravity
    </p>
    <p>
      the tilt of your planet will determine how extreme seasons are, lower tilt
      means less extreme seasons
    </p>
    <p>
      The temp of your planet will influince where biomes can be believably
      placed onto your world.
    </p>
    <p>
      the orbit of your planet will determine how long a year is, the closer to
      the sun the shorter the year
    </p>
    <p>
      the orbit of your planet will also determine how long a day is, the closer
      to the sun the longer the day
    </p>
    <p>
      The level of resources is also changeable, does your world have lower
      oxygen levels? high deposits of whatever magic element you created in the
      PHYSICS section?
    </p>
    <p>
      More detailed magic systems and world maps will be looked at later. For
      now focus on the overall world
