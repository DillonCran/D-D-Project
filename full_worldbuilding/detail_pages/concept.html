    <h1>Concepts and ideas</h1>

    <p>We need to set up goals and basic concepts that will be the bedrock of your world!</p>
    <p>Fantasy or scifi?  Earthlike or unique?</p>
    <p>THese decisions will heavily influince your process going forward</p>

    <p>concept: what defines your world at its most basic level.</p>
    <p>(ex. a romance between two friends, a bustling city, )</p>
    <p>General concepts allow for freedome, and specific ones are more restrictive.  There is no better or best option.  THis is what YOU want rather than what is best.</p>
    <p>Please establish 5 different concepts to influince your world</p>
