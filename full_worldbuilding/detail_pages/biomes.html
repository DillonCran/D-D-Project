    <h3>A note on life</h3>
    <p>
      Before we lay out the Biomes we should first establish what life looks
      like on your world
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is a very broad topic, and we will only be covering the basics here
    </p>
    <p>Life is made up of 3 main kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi</p>
    <p>Within the different kingdoms there are varius sub-categories of life</p>
    <p>
      Animalia is broken down into: Mammalia, Reptilia, Amphibia, Insects, and
      more
    </p>
    <p>
      Plantae is broken down into: Trees, Shrubs, Grasses, Mosses, Ferns, and
      more
    </p>
    <p>Fungi is broken down into: Mushrooms, Molds, Yeasts, and more</p>
    <p>
      As we go through the different biomes, please make animals that would be
      suited to that environment
    </p>
    <p>
      These made-up creatures can be used alongside earth animals. No limits!

    <h3>Biomes</h3>
    <h4>Tropical Rainforests</h4>
    <p>
      These are the most biodiverse biomes on the planet. Typically found near
      the equator and are hot, humid, and recieve lots of rain
    </p>
    <p>
      For hotter worlds, The tropics move polewards. Colder worlds may not have
      tropics at all.
    </p>
    <p>Tropics tend to have a wide variety of biodiversity</p>
    <p>
      Almost any kind of animal can be found here, often adapting to climb trees
      and deal with the heat/humidity
    </p>
    <p>
      Some animals that live here are: Monkeys, Parrots, Frogs, Snakes, and more
    </p>
    <p>
      Plants in the tropics often have to comete heavily with eachother, leading
      to very tall trees with closed canopeys
    </p>
    <p>
      Often plants will grow on top of other plants in symbiosis, and fungi
      enjoy the dense forest floor
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of what kind of fruits/nuts trees may have, or how they have
      uniquely adapted to the tropics to fill a niche
    </p>
    <p>Some plants that live here are: Trees, Vines, Ferns, and more</p>
    <p>Some fungi that live here are: Mushrooms, Molds, and more</p>
    <p>Try and make 3x plants, and 3x animals</p>

    <h4>Savannas</h4>
    <p>
      These are the second most biodiverse biomes on the planet. Typically found
      near the tropics and are hot, dry with little rain.
    </p>
    <p>Typically 1x wet season in the spring, with droughts in the summer/autumn</p>
    <p>During droughted summers wildfires can be quite common and often animals migrate between seasons.</p>
    <p>Between Savannas and Tropics is a buffer biome called a Monsoon biome that acts as a more humid savanna</p>
    <p>Savannas can typically be found north or south of the equator up to the subtropic line</p>
    <p>
      Animals in the Savanna typically either fast, burrowing, or migrate in large herds.
      Predators are often very fast and have high perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some animals that live here are: Elephants, Giraffes, Lions, Hyenas, and
      more
    </p>
    <p>Plants in this biome must be adapted for both wildfires and droughts.  Trees will not form solid canopeys and are often soletary, with tall grasses and hardy shrubs</p>
    <p>Create 3x plants and 3x animals</p>

    <h4>Deserts</h4>
    <p>Deserts can vary widely in appearance, but all have very little percipitation with little vegitation</p>
    <p>Between deserts and their neighbouring biomes Steppes provide a rockey buffer biome.</p>
    <p>Deserts can be found basically anywhere on the planet, but have a few rules</p>
    <p>Rainshadow is the effect when humid air makes land contact where a mountain range is near the coast.  The humid air travels up the mountain, losing its humidity beofr falling down the other side of the mountain, creating a rainshadow effect</p>
    <p>Deserts can also be found in larger interiors of continents, both hot and cold climates</p>
    <p>Colder planets will have more poleward deserts</p>
    <p>Water currents also play a roll in desert formation, with desert coastlines being fronted by cold currents.</p>
    <p>Plants in the desert will need to adapt to the hot, dry environment.</p>
    <p>Some plants that live here are: Cacti, Succulents, Yakka, Tumbleweeds</p>
    <p>Animals in the desert will need to adapt to the hot, dry environment as well.  Leading to very efficient predators and stealthy/quick prey</p>
    <p>Venom is a very common IRL adaptation seen in deserts</p>
    <p>Create 3x plants and 3x animals</p>

    <h4>sub-tropical</h4>
    <p>Sub-tropics are found between 30-60 degrees N and S of the equator, following warm water currents</p>
    <p>Usually has 1 dry season in summer,spring, or autumn</p>
    <p>While it is not as dense of humid as the tropics, many tropical life can live here</p>
    <p>Summers are usually very rainy, with 1 season consistant with heavy rain/storms (Tornados, lightning, hurricains)</p>
    <p>There will be 4 uniquely distinct seasons</p>
    <p>Plants and animals in the sub-tropics will be very similar to the tropics, but will have to deal with the cold winters and sudden storms</p>
    <p>Create 3x plants and 3x animals</p>

    <h4>Wetlands</h4>
    <p>Wetlands are found in low-lying areas, often near the coast with sub-tropical biomes</p>
    <p>Wetlands are often very humid, with lots of rain and fog.  COmbined with flat wide open spaces the environment will get waterlogged</p>
    <p>Examples of wetland biomes are Bogs, Marshes, and Peatlands</p>
    <p>Wetlands are often very biodiverse, with many animals and plants living in the waterlogged environment</p>
    <p>Plants in the wetlands will need to adapt to the waterlogged environment, often with very shallow roots and floating leaves</p>
    <p>Some plants that live here are: Lillies, Reeds, Mangroves, rice</p>
    <p>Animals in the wetlands will need to adapt to the waterlogged environment as well, often with webbed feet, long beaks, flight, and cold-bloodedness</p>
    <p>Some animals that live here are: Ducks, Frogs, Crocodiles, and Lizards</p>
    <p>Create 3x plants and 3x animals</p>

    <h4>Mediterranian</h4>
    <p>Mediterranian biomes are found between 30-45 degrees N and S of the equator, following warm water currents</p>
    <p>Fair weather, Dry summers, and consistant 4 full seasons</p>
    <p>Environment shrub & woodlands, very fertile soil from annual flooding/irrigation</p>
    <p>Mediterrainian climates can be hot-warm-cool depending on proximity to poles/warm or cool currents</p>
    <p>Plants and animals will be adapted to the fertile soil and seasoned forests</p>
    <p>This is the location most likely to create Formable Crops</p>
    <p>Some plants that live here are: Olives, Grapes, and Maple</p>
    <p>Some animals that live here are: Deer, Rabbits, and Wolves</p>
    <p>Create 3x plants and 3x animals</p>

    <h4>Oceanic</h4>
    <p>Oceanic biomes are found 50-75 degrees N and S of the equator</p>
    <p>Having a wet, rainy, coastal climate with no dry seasons but warm summers, following warm currents</p>
    <p>May also have an abundance of basin-lakes</p>
    <p>Environment is often very rocky, with lots of cliffs and mountains</p>
    <p>Plants and animals will be adapted to the rocky environment and wet climate</p>
    <p>Some plants that live here are: Redwood, rock-pines, Seaweed, and Algae</p>
    <p>Some animals that live here are: Seals, Penguins, Squirrels, Raccoons</p>
    <p>Create 3x plants and 3x animals</p>

    <h4>Highlands</h4>
    <p>Highland biomes are found in the higher elevations of mountains, in general are rare</p>
    <p>Highland biomes are often very cold, with lots of snow and ice, in dry winters and cold summers</p>
    <p>Environment is often very rocky, with lots of cliffs and mountains, along plateaus</p>
    <p>Animals tend to be scarce in this environment due to the altitude, cold, and low levels of vegitation</p>
    <p>Plants in the highlands are often low to the ground, tall seasonal grasses and hardy bush</p>
    <p>create 1x plant and 1x animal</p>

    <h4>Continental</h4>
    <p>Continental biomes are found in the interior of continents with no access to waterways, in general are less common but tend to span large areas</p>
    <p>Generally colder/drier, but not much snow or percipitation</p>
    <p>typially found along the 60 degree N & S of the equator</p>
    <p>Examples of is are Canadian plains, Mongolian steppes</p>
    <p>Plant life is often low lying and homogenous, with tall grasses and taigas</p>
    <p>Animal life is often very diverse, with large herds of grazing animals and predators</p>
    <p>create 1x plant and 1x animal</p>

    <h4>Boreal</h4>
    <p>Boreal biomes are very similar to Continental biomes, but colder</p>
    <p>Hemiboreal is a transisionary biome between boreal and other warmer biomes</p>
    <p>Boreal environments tend to be very cold and while not much percipitation snowy</p>
    <p>Found in the 60-80 degree N & S of the equator</p>
    <p>Examples of this are the Siberian tundra, and the Canadian tundra</p>
    <p>Plant life is often very sparse, with low lying grasses and mosses, and taigas</p>
    <p>Animal life is often very large to adapt to the cold, with large herds of grazing animals.  Typically very furry and scavanging.  Hibernation</p>
    <p>create 2x plant and 2x animal</p>

    <h4>Arctic</h4>
    <p>Arctic biomes are found at the N & S poles</p>
    <p>Arctic areas are split into two categories, icecap and tundra</p>
    <p>Tundra are rocky and cold arctic environments with almost no vegitation.  Summer grasses and shrubs.  Animals are either predators or small scavangers/semiaquatic</p>
    <p>Tundra typically has 1x warm season where snow melts, leaving soggy waterlogged terrain, and rocky</p>
    <p>Icecap are frozen wastelands with no vegitation.  Animals are either large predators or semiaquatic</p>
    <p>Seasons in this biome are varied but will have long dark winters, and permaday</p>
    <p>Warmer worlds may not have Icecaps at all, only draw on map if theyre permenant</p>
    <p>create 1x plant and 1x animal for both Tundra and Icecap</p>
