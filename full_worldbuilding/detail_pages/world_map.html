    <h1>Creating your world in detail!</h1>

    <h3>World Map</h3>
    <p>Start with a blank map of "all water"</p>
    <p>
      Split the map into continents, drawing 10-30 "plates" connected on the
      map. 3 plate corners meeting is OK, 4 is not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select which plates youve drawn you want to be continental (in the general
      shap of what you want your continents to look like). The rest will remain
      oceanic plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      remember to make sure the left and right sides of the map match up their
      plates, Its a globe!
    </p>
    <p>
      The north and south can be covered win polar icecaps for simplicity in map
      drawing, but its not necissary and you can draw it however you like
    </p>
    <p>Depending on your world temp there may not be any icecaps at all!</p>
    <p>
      Now imagine the continents shifting around along the mantel of your world.
      Draw arrows for their direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Draw the plates as they move, and the land masses as they collide and
      break apart, creating mountain ranges and others.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>How moving continents effects the surface:</p>
    <p>3 types of plate coundries:Divergent, Convergent, and Transform</p>
    <p>
      Divergent oceanic plates: Magma rises under the ocean and creates
      underwater volcanos, maybe volcanic islands
    </p>
    <p>
      divergent continental plates: Lava rises but will fall below sea level,
      making inlets/canals between continental plates
    </p>
    <p>
      Convergent oceanic Plates: One mantel goes under the other, creating ocean
      trenches and volcanic islands
    </p>
    <p>
      Convergent continental Plates: Thick continental plates buckle upwards,
      creating large mountain ranges along the fault
    </p>
    <p>
      Convergent continental-oceanic plates: Thinner oceanic plate goes under
      continental plate, creating costal underwater trench with cliff/mountain
      coastline
    </p>
    <p>
      Transform: When plates move in parallel directions to another, no real
      change only earthquakes
    </p>
    <p>
      The plates will continue to move and change the surface of your world
      until they reach a balance, and then they will stop moving.
    </p>

    <h3>Planet Systems</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have the placement of your continents, and finished the movements
      of the plates to create features
    </p>
    <p>
      The main systems a planet has are the wind systems and ocean currents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wind systems are created by the rotation of the planet, and the ocean
      currents are created by the wind systems.

    <p>
      If your world rotates in the opposite direction of earth, systems will be
      flipped
    </p>
    <p>
      starting from the equator, the water should be flowing right-left. Flowing
      warm water along any coastline that intersects with its movements (both
      north and south)
    </p>
    <p>
      As the current running along the coastline approaches the next set of
      winds, the water will cool off as it leaves the equator and be pushed by
      the winds, forming circular patterns of hot water leaving the equator and
      cool water returning.

      This is not a bad map generator, but I encourage you to make your own
      <a href="https://topps.diku.dk/torbenm/maps.msp">World Map Generator</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Other Features</h3>
    <p>
      At this point you can add any other features to your map that you may
      want. Lakes, rivers, hills, notible metal deposits
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that rivers flow from high to low, and will always flow to the
      ocean. Avoid creating rivrs with large deltas at the mouth
    </p>
    <p>
      Metal deposits can be located anywhere on the map, but have general
      outlines for what kinds of metals are found where
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountains are the best place to find metal deposits, as they are formed by
      convergent plates
    </p>
    <p>
      Coal: Deposits are found where low laying swamps USED to contain life, but
      can be anywhere on a map. Just not inside main mountain chains
    </p>
    <p>
      Oil & gas: Will naturally seep up into swamps over time, or be trapped
      underground in rock/salt deposits
    </p>
    <p>Salt: Can be found in salt pans, or places that were once deserts</p>
    <p>
      Gold, Cpper, Tin-Tungston: Will form deposits are typically found along
      volcanic fault lines with trace amounts of lead-zinc-silver
    </p>
    <p>
      Iron, Tin, Gold: Found in old mountain chains or swamps, can also rarely
      have Gold, Cobalt, Magnese, Lead, Silver, Cadmium
    </p>
    <p>
      Nickle, Platinum, Iriduium: These should be found generally in the older
      central-basins of larger continents, DIamonds can also be rarely found
      here
    </p>
    <p>
      Aluminium & other metals: Put these in your rainforsests and coastal
      rainy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that you have the continents laid out, mountain ranges and other
      features plotted, and winds/currents plotted we can start laying out the
      biomes!
