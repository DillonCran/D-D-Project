    <h1>Steps for a believable Universe</h1>

    <p>
      Layed out in concepts should be whether if your world is SCIFI or fantasy
    </p>
    <p>
      FOr this tutorial it will mostly be focused on a sigular world, which is
      more inclined to fantasy, but can be SCIFI too
    </p>
    <p>
      You should start with a general creation story, the people in your world
      can know this but dont need to.
    </p>
    <p>
      IRL example (big bang -> expansion -> cooling)(God creating earth in 7
      days)
    </p>
    <p>
      These are not necissary for a world to be believable, but adding these
      will help with worldbuilding later
    </p>
    <p>
      Pick a general shape/colour for your galaxy. Life is most likely to form
      on the outskirts of the galaxy
    </p>
    <p>
      IRL example (Milky way is a spiral galaxy, massive black hole at centre,
      with a blueish tint)
